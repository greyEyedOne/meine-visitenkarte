    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        I’m a detail-oriented and creative web developer with a background in fullstack development
        and a strong focus on clean, responsive frontend design. After switching careers from
        engineering, I’ve been working on digital products since 2022 — building modular websites,
        interactive components, and optimizing performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve contributed to affiliate platforms, internal tools, and custom landing pages for
        startups and small businesses across Germany and beyond. Currently, I’m working on personal
        projects (Nuxt 4, Vue 3, Tailwind), growing my tech stack, and open to freelance or
        collaborative opportunities.
      </p>

        When I’m not coding, I enjoy cycling, reading books, and learning new things. A couple of
        months ago, I started learning German and really enjoy this rich and musical language.
